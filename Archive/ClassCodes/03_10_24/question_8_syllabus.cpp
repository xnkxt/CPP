//Design three classes: Student, Exam and Result. 
//The student class has data members such as roll no, name etc. 
//Create a class Exam by inheriting the Student class. 
//The Exam class adds data members representing the marks scored in six subjects. 
//Derive the Result from class Exam and it has its own members such as total marks. 
//Write an interactive program to model this relationship. What type of inheritance this model belongs to? do it in C++ 
//Answer - This model uses multilevel inheritance, as Exam inherits from Student, and Result inherits from Exam.
